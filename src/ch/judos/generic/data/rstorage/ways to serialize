todo:

- escape sequence for custom serialization (escape all brackets, otherwise tagged
  object can't be distinguished from serialized non-tagged)

different cases for RStorage:

- your class implements RStorableManual2 (define manually how to serialize)

future:

- easy methods to use for RStorableManual2 (basically serialize anything)
- your own class implements RStorable2 (gets serialized automatically)
- you define some other class as RStorable2 (gets serialized automatically)
